## To run the project

First, clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/deepdeev/proyecto5.git`

Then run `meteor npm intall` for all the dependencies needed.

Then in the project directory, `run meteor`. This will run the application and tell you if there are any missing dependencies that you should install

### Notes
When you run the application, you will get warnings related to the meteor version that we are using. Ignore them.
